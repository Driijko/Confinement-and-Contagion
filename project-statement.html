            <h2>PROJECT STATEMENT</h2>
            <p>
                Confinement and Contagion is an upcoming exhibition and workshop series for artists affected by the prison system to share their work and their stories. In partnership with three Toronto-based prisoners’ rights and advocacy organizations—Literal Change, Toronto Prisoners’ Rights Project, and PASAN—the project will bring to light the vulnerability of racialized incarcerated people and those in their networks to adverse physical and mental health impacts. Using artworks and participatory workshops, Confinement and Contagion advocates for prisoner health. The project champions actionable reconciliation with Black, Indigenous, and People of Colour, LGBTQ2S+, and other equity-seeking communities experiencing intersecting identities. This project was made possible by the presenting partner, Myseum of Toronto, to be featured at the 7th annual Myseum Intersections festival, opening in April 2022.
